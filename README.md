I made a website about three different recipes what they are and where they come from and how to make them.

I used skills like creating relative links to different websites, structuring my project and use elements like paragraphs, headings, lists and pictures. 

I already knew how to do it because i knew basic elements of html already before odin but working with git on an actual project really helped and revised how to use it.
