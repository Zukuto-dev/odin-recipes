    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Pierogi are traditional Polish dumplings made of soft, unleavened dough
      filled with a variety of savory or sweet ingredients. Common savory fillings include
      potatoes, cheese, sauerkraut, or ground meat, while sweet versions may contain fruits or sweetened cheese.
      Pierogi are typically boiled, then fried in butter until golden brown, and are often served with sour cream or fried onions.
