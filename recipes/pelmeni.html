    <h3>Description</h3>

<p> Pelmeni are traditional Russian dumplings made of thin, unleavened dough filled with a variety of savory ingredients. The dough is typically made from flour, water, and eggs, creating a soft and pliable texture that is easy to work with. The fillings for pelmeni can vary, but the most common combinations include ground meat, such as beef, pork, or lamb, often mixed with onions, garlic, and spices like salt and pepper. Once filled, the dumplings are folded into small, crescent or round shapes, and pinched tightly to seal the edges. Pelmeni are usually boiled until tender and are served hot, often garnished with sour cream, butter, or vinegar.
