    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Pelmeni are traditional Russian dumplings made of thin, unleavened dough
      filled with a variety of savory ingredients. The dough is typically made
      from flour, water, and eggs, creating a soft and pliable texture that is
      easy to work with. The fillings for pelmeni can vary, but the most common
      combinations include ground meat, such as beef, pork, or lamb, often mixed
      with onions, garlic, and spices like salt and pepper. Once filled, the
      dumplings are folded into small, crescent or round shapes, and pinched
      tightly to seal the edges. Pelmeni are usually boiled until tender and are
      served hot, often garnished with sour cream, butter, or vinegar.

        Make the Dough: Mix flour, water, and eggs to form a smooth, elastic
        dough. Knead it briefly, then let it rest for about 30 minutes. Roll the
        dough out thinly on a floured surface.

        Prepare the Filling and Shape the Pelmeni: Combine ground meat (such as
        beef, pork, or lamb) with finely chopped onions, garlic, salt, and
        pepper. Cut the dough into small circles, place a spoonful of filling in
        the center of each, then fold the dough over the filling and pinch the
        edges to seal.

        Cook the Pelmeni: Boil the pelmeni in salted water for about 4-5 minutes
